# CoralRelabeler

CoralRelabeler is a simple tool made to create or improve existing ground truths of coral reef image.
The tool was developed with speedy annotation in mind.

# How does it work?
The software uses Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to automatically extract a homogenously textured patch, with a gaussian dropout weight. The patch center is controlled by clicking, and the gaussian dropout sigma with mouse wheel (to grow and shink the selection).
